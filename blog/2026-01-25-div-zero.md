## handle the error

When nemu running, we may meet errors which may lead to the program dump.
And sometimes we don't wanna the program fail,
we need to catch the error and handle it.
<!-- truncate -->

## where it comes from

In `expr`, we may meet `p someNumber / 0` or in the progress `val1 / val2`
and the `val2 == 0`. It is possible to avoid this happening.

## how to handle

To handle this error, we can check the `val2` before calculating.
And add a state flag `*success` to check whether there is any problem.

change `eval`
