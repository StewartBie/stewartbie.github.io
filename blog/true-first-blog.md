It's been a while since I first have the idea to build a blog. Though the contents are still full of useless pages. But I'm convinced that I stepped the first time and bad is better than never.

## Ways to Start

1. Install docusaurus, with npm or yarn. Refer to the document.
2. Change some files, and prepare for deployment.
3. Create a git repo then push to Github
4. yarn deploy
